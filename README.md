If Titan got such a cool little brother, "Tiny Titan",
 why can't Summit have Tiny Summit?

## Design Specifications

This project is meant to display the use of water cooling in HPC. All prototypes should keep the following componants visible:
 * 8 NVIDIA Jetson TX2s (with LEDs on front)
 * 1 water reservoir of undecided size with attached radiator (essentially a box)
 * Pipage to connect Jetson and resevoir

Other components include
 * 1 Raspberry Pi Model 3
 * 10 or 16 port Network Switch
 * Ethernet cables
 * Power supplies for Jetsons, Raspberry Pi, Radiator, and Switch

Available STEP files for components follow:
 * [NVIDIA Jetson TX2](refs/jetson-top_asm.rar)
 * [Raspberry Pi Model 3](refs/Raspberry_B_step.rar)

If there are any questions, please contact us at ugc (at) ornl.gov

Please add a branch to this repository and upload your files as STL and STEP.

Thank you!
